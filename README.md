# My blog site built by Gatsby

## How to Run

develop:

    $ gatsby develop

build:

    $ gatsby build

when install npm, use `yarn add` instead of `npm install`.

if it has some wierd problems when run `gatsby develop` or `gatsby build`, try delete `.cache` and `public` folders then do it again.
